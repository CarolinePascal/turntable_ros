This file describes the installation and configuration for USB-348A Linux Driver


STEP 1: UNPACK
==============

Decompress the usbgpib_src_v203.tgz :
     tar xvzf usbgpib_src_v203.tgz

This will extract the 'usbgpib' directory with the following 
subdirectories:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
drivers/ contains the device modules, configuration file and
         installation script
drvsrc/  contains the source of adgpib kernel driver
lib/	 contains the shared library and source of lib - libadgpib32.so/libadgpib64.so 
samples/ contains some sample programs

B: COMPILE
==============

a) compiling drivers
---------------------------
1. cd to usbgpib/drvsrc directory
2. Type "make". 

If the driver is built successfully, the driver “usbgpibfl.ko”, “usbgpibflad.ko” and "u348a.ko" are located in usbgpib/driver/’kernel_verion’.
If the kernel version is 4.4.0-21-generic, the driver is located in usbgpib/driver/4.4.0-21-generic.

3. For the system automatically loads the driver during boot time,
run the following command to install the driver:

#make install

The system will automatically load the driver during boot time.

b) compiling software library
------------------------------
1. cd to usbgpib/lib directory
2. Type "make". 
 
C: CONFIGURE AND LOAD DEVICE
===================================
1. Modify gpib interface configuration file, usbgpib/drivers/adgpib.cfg   
2. Loading driver and library 
for i686
   usbgpib/drivers/adgpib_inst.pl   for driver loading
for x86_64
   usbgpib/drivers/adgpib_inst64.pl   for driver loading

After initial driver installation, the driver is loaded.

3. Using the lsmod command to verify the driver is loaded:

#lsmod | grep u348a

output is shown is like the following
u348a 57407 0

D: INSTALL LIBRARY
=======================

The library is provided as a ELF shared library. 
To install the library, type the following command:
for i686
   cp <InstallDir>/usbgpib/lib/libadgpib32.so /usr/lib
for x86_64
   cp <InstallDir>/usbgpib/lib/libadgpib64.so /usr/lib

In addition, adgpib_inst.pl/adgpib_inst64.pl also involves the installation for the library.
